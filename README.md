## ?? What Does It Do?

Your Executive Assistant is like having a personal secretary on your Mac that:

- ? **Cleans Your Email** - Automatically finds and removes spam (saved me from losing 11GB of emails!)
- ? **Manages Multiple Email Accounts** - Yahoo, Gmail, Hotmail, Comcast, iCloud all in one place
- ? **Schedules Meetings** - Just say "Schedule meeting with John next Thursday at 2pm" and it's done
- ? **Drafts Emails for You** - AI writes emails in YOUR writing style
- ? **Organizes Contacts** - Never lose a phone number or email again
- ? **Creates Documents** - Makes PowerPoint presentations, memos, and drawings
- ? **Learns Your Priorities** - Gets smarter over time about what's important to you
- ? **Works Offline** - AI runs on YOUR Mac, not in the cloud
